# Reminder Of Things

README

This is a IoT project based on Intel Edison, which has a light sensor attached to it, a Node.js web server that checks for user's Google calendar to schedule readings from the sensor and Android app to receive notifications. 
The App is used to check if the user is carrying something important that has been placed on the sensor just when they're about to leave based on their Google Calendar.
